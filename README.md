**This Project is made to train the datasets of marla property price by determining which types of model algorithm fits the datasets the best (Regression Task or Classification Task)**

# **In regression tasks:**

The target variable is continuous and quantitative in nature. For example, predicting the price of a house, the salary of an employee, or the sales amount of a product.
The goal is to estimate or predict the numerical value of the target variable based on the input features or independent variables.
Common regression algorithms include linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, and support vector regression.

# **In classification tasks:**

The target variable is categorical or qualitative in nature. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not (binary classification), classifying an image into different categories like dog, cat, or horse (multi-class classification).
The goal is to assign an instance (represented by the input features) to one of the predefined classes or categories.
Common classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), and neural networks.
To summarize:

Regression is used for predicting continuous numerical values.
Classification is used for predicting discrete class labels or categories.
